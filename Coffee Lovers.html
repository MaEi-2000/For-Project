<p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans ,which are the seeds of berries from
 the Coffee plant. the genus Coffee is native to tropical Africa and Madagascar,the comoros, Mauritius,
 and reunion in the Indian Ocean.The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world.</p>
<p>There might be a reason why a cup of coffee can turn a morning frown into a smile. There's growing evidence
 that coffee bosts dopamine production in the brain .One study found that women who drank four or more cups
 of coffee every day were 20% less likely to suffer from depression. Another found that coffee drinkers were half
 as llikely to attempt suicide.</p>  
<p>A study that accounted for poor life-style habits(eating red meat and skipping exercise, for instant),found that 
those  who drank  at least   one cup of coffee each day lowered their risk of dyingfrom life-style related health problems
over the period of a decade. Coffee could very well deliver a wealth of benefits, but don't fill up just yet .Some research
 has tied drinking large amount of unfiltered coffee llike espresso to increased cholesterol levels, most likely due to cafestol.
</p>  
<p>Studies have shown that may  have health benefits, including protective Parkinson's disease such as diabetes and liver disease. Coffee appeaars of depression. So how quickly we metabolize
coffee may affect our health risk.</p><br>
